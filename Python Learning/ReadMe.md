# Python Learning 
## CLO : 01
### (Time Duration: 3 Weeks)

# 1. Introduction to Python:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. We will be learning basics of python language to use it in Big Data Analysis.
# 2. Course Learning Objectives
1. To familiarize with python basics (3 weeks/ Lecture 1-6)

# 3. List of Software
#### 1. Python setup	
(Open source)

# 4. Lecture Breakdown:
There will be 2 lectures per week. Lecture wise details of the topics is decribed in th next section. 

# 5. Introduction to the Topics:
### 1. Introduction to Python
This is chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs. Where, you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Moreover, in this first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book.
### 2. Python Data types (part 1):
In this lecture we will be covering Strings and Lists, and moving into data structures. As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables. Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.
### 3.	Python Data types (part 2):
The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures. Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs. Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory "database" in a single Python variable. Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure. Tuples are a simple version of lists. We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.
### 4. Conditional Statements and Loops:
Condition statement is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes "choices".   Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.

### 5.	Functions and Array:
This is the lecture to learn about the implementations of the concepts we studied above with the help of functions and arrays.


### 6.	Classes/Objects, Math, JSON:
In this lecture, we will create classes/object to learn the object oriented programming. We work with Application Program Interfaces / Web Services using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format.
